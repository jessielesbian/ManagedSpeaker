# ManagedSpeaker
ManagedSpeaker: an open-source text-to-speech engine made entirely out of c#

It is a dictionary-based speech synthesis software, which means that the dictionary must get populated with another text-to-speech software.
ManagedSpeaker used Google Translate to populate it's dictionary on-the-fly and filters to make the speech sound more natural. It only supports wave file output currently.

Here's the public key token of most of the files (except Newtonsoft.Json.dll): 8483827471a77a04
